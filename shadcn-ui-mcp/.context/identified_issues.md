# Identified Issues and Areas for Improvement

## Code Quality Issues

1. **Limited Test Coverage**
   - The test suite is minimal with only basic integration tests
   - Missing unit tests for schema validation functions
   - No test coverage for HTTP transport functionality
   - Component preview and visualization features are untested

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Some error handling is generic and doesn't provide specific error messages
   - Missing proper error categorization (user errors vs. system errors)
   - Limited retry logic for network operations
   - Some edge cases may not be properly handled

3. **Component Preview Implementation**
   - The screenshot functionality is only a placeholder and not fully implemented
   - The component preview requires starting a temporary Next.js server which may be resource-intensive
   - Missing cleanup logic for temporary files created during preview

## Feature Gaps

1. **Monorepo Support Limitations**
   - Limited testing with different monorepo setups (Turborepo, Nx, Yarn Workspaces)
   - Path resolution may not be robust for all monorepo configurations
   - Missing documentation for complex monorepo scenarios

2. **Component Visualization**
   - Screenshot functionality is only stubbed out, not fully implemented
   - Limited styling options for the component preview
   - No support for theme switching in the preview
   - Missing responsive view options

3. **Cross-Registry Search**
   - Basic implementation without advanced filtering or sorting
   - Limited optimization for handling multiple registries
   - No caching mechanism for registry data
   - Missing relevance ranking for search results

## Documentation Issues

1. **Missing API Documentation**
   - The README covers tool functionality but lacks detailed API documentation
   - Missing examples for error handling and advanced scenarios
   - Limited troubleshooting guidance

2. **Incomplete Code Comments**
   - Some complex functions lack detailed comments
   - Missing JSDoc comments for some public functions
   - Limited explanation of design decisions

## Technical Debt

1. **Schema Evolution**
   - No versioning mechanism for schema changes
   - Limited backward compatibility planning
   - Missing migration tools for updating component configurations

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Using direct `exec` calls to npm/npx which may be brittle
   - Limited validation of shadcn/ui CLI version compatibility
   - No graceful fallback for registry API changes

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - The component preview feature may be resource-intensive
   - No caching mechanism for registry data
   - Registry operations may be slow for large component sets

## Security Considerations

1. **Command Injection Risk**
   - Using string concatenation for command execution
   - Limited input sanitization for file paths and component names
   - Missing validation for registry URLs

2. **File Access Control**
   - No explicit checks for file permissions
   - Missing validation for paths to prevent directory traversal
   - Limited isolation for file operations
