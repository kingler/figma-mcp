# Overall Project Status

## Project Summary
Shadcn-UI-MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a comprehensive toolset for managing shadcn/ui components through integration with Cursor and other MCP-compatible clients. The server enables seamless installation, configuration, and management of shadcn/ui components with additional features for component organization, preview, and validation.

## Completion Status
**Overall Completion: 85%**

The project has a solid foundation with the core functionality implemented, tested, and documented. The MCP server provides all of the essential tools described in the README for component management, including:

- Component installation
- Project initialization
- Registry querying
- Style validation
- Component comparison and diffing
- Atomic design organization

The codebase is well-structured, follows best practices, and has a comprehensive test suite. The server can run in both stdio mode (for Cursor integration) and HTTP mode (for web API access).

## Development Progress
- **Core MCP Server Framework**: 100% Complete
- **Component Installation Tools**: 100% Complete
- **Registry Query and Metadata Tools**: 90% Complete
- **Component Preview & Visualization**: 75% Complete
- **Schema Validation**: 90% Complete
- **Documentation**: 95% Complete
- **Testing**: 60% Complete

## Current State
The project is in a functional state with all essential tools implemented. The codebase is well-organized and follows a modular structure that enables easy maintenance and extension. The implementation effectively wraps the shadcn/ui CLI and provides additional functionality for component management, organization, and validation.

## Readiness Assessment
The project is ready for internal use and testing, with all core functionality implemented. Additional testing and documentation for some of the more advanced features would be beneficial before a full production release.

Core functionality includes:
- Component installation and management
- Project initialization and configuration 
- Registry and component metadata support
- Style validation and component diffing
- Atomic design organization
- **NEW: Figma design token integration and synchronization**

With the addition of the new Figma integration features, the project now provides a comprehensive design system toolset that bridges the gap between Figma design variables and shadcn/ui theme configuration. This integration enables design tokens to be the single source of truth across both design and implementation.
