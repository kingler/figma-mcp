# AI Reasoning MCP - Overall Project Status

## Summary
The AI Reasoning MCP project is approximately 85% complete and is in a working state. The server provides a range of AI reasoning capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface, with a focus on knowledge management, logical reasoning, decision support, and ethical validation.

## Key Components Status
1. **Knowledge Base System**: 95% complete
   - Triple storage and retrieval implementation is fully functional
   - Fact management with evidence and confidence scoring is implemented
   - Rule repository with inference capabilities is working

2. **MCP Server Integration**: 90% complete
   - Server properly registers all tools with the MCP protocol
   - Request handling framework is established
   - Response formatting needs improvement

3. **Storage System**: 90% complete
   - Primary LevelGraph database backend works with persistent storage
   - In-memory fallback system implemented for resilience
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms are in place

4. **Reasoning Capabilities**: 80% complete
   - Core reasoning methods are implemented (deductive, inductive, abductive)
   - Decision support tools are functional
   - Ethical validation framework is in place
   - All reasoning methods need more robust implementations

5. **Testing**: 75% complete
   - Unit tests for the knowledge base services are solid
   - Integration tests for the MCP server could be improved
   - End-to-end tests are limited

## Current State
The system is operational and can be used for reasoning tasks through the MCP protocol. The server successfully responds to all API calls without errors, though the response content formatting could be improved. The in-memory fallback system provides resilience against database connection issues.

## Progress Since Last Assessment
- Implemented in-memory fallback for the graph database
- Fixed module import issues for ES modules
- Enhanced error handling throughout the system
- Improved server resilience against database connection problems

## Overall Completion: 85%
