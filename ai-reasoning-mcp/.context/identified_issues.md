# AI Reasoning MCP - Identified Issues

## Critical Issues
1. **Response Formatting Issues**
   - The server responds with empty JSON objects (`{}`) for all tool calls
   - Response content is not properly formatted according to MCP specifications
   - Issue appears to be in the response formatting logic in `index.ts`

2. **Database Lock Persistence**
   - While in-memory fallback has been implemented, database lock files can persist
   - Needs a more robust cleanup mechanism for database locks

## Major Issues

3. **Limited Implementation of Reasoning Methods**
   - Reasoning methods (deductive, inductive, abductive) have implemented interfaces but simplified logic
   - Need to implement more robust reasoning algorithms for each method
   
4. **Database Transaction Support**
   - No proper transaction support for multi-operation sequences
   - Could lead to data inconsistency if operations fail mid-sequence

5. **Test Coverage Gaps**
   - Limited test coverage for reasoning capabilities
   - No integration tests for the full MCP server
   - No end-to-end tests with a client interacting with the server

## Minor Issues

6. **Error Handling Refinement**
   - Some error paths lack specific error codes or descriptive messages
   - Better error feedback needed for clients

7. **Performance Considerations**
   - No performance testing or benchmarking
   - May have scaling issues with large knowledge bases

8. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Missing detailed documentation for some API endpoints
   - Architecture documentation is incomplete
   - More usage examples needed for complex reasoning operations

## Technical Debt

9. **Type Definitions**
   - Some areas use `any` types instead of proper type definitions
   - TypeScript configuration could be stricter

10. **Code Structure**
    - Some monolithic methods could be refactored into smaller, more testable units
    - Class responsibilities could be better defined and separated

11. **Dependency Management**
    - Fixed versions for some dependencies which could lead to security issues
    - No automated vulnerability scanning

## Feature Gaps

12. **Missing Data Management Features**
    - No backup and restore capabilities
    - No migration tools for schema changes

13. **Monitoring and Logging**
    - Limited logging throughout the application
    - No metrics collection for monitoring system health

14. **Security Considerations**
    - No authentication or authorization mechanisms
    - No rate limiting or request validation
