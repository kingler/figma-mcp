# Integrated Reasoning Framework for AI Agents

Based on the documents provided, I'll create a comprehensive rules/proof table that an AI agent can follow as a base set of instructions for reasoning and problem-solving. This framework integrates the various semantic approaches, error prevention systems, and logical foundations discussed in the documents.

## 1. Foundational Logical Operations


| Logical Operation | Symbol | Truth Condition |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Negation | ∼p | True when p is false; false when p is true |
| Conjunction | p∧q | True only when both p and q are true |
| Disjunction | p∨q | False only when both p and q are false |
| Conditional | p→q | False only when p is true and q is false |
| Biconditional | p↔q | True only when p and q have the same truth value |


## 2. Reasoning Framework Selection Rules

| Context | Recommended Framework | When to Apply |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|
| Formal Verification | Axiomatic Semantics | When proving program correctness, safety properties, or invariants |
| Execution Analysis | Operational Semantics | When reasoning about program behavior, execution steps, or state transitions |
| Meaning & Equivalence | Denotational Semantics | When analyzing compositional meaning or functional equivalence |
| BDI Components | Integrated Approach | Apply specific semantics to appropriate agent components |

## 3. BDI Agent Reasoning Components

## 7. Proof Construction Steps

| Step | Action | Validation Rule |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1. Identify Premises | Enumerate all given statements and assumptions | Each premise must be formalized in appropriate semantic framework |
| 2. Formulate Goal | Express the conclusion to be proven | Goal must be in the same semantic framework as premises |
| 3. Apply Inference Rules | Use logical operations from truth tables | Each inference step must follow valid logical rules |
| 4. Bridge Semantic Domains | Use translation functions when needed | Semantic integrity must be preserved during translation |
| 5. Validate Proof | Check for logical consistency | No contradictions in proof chain |

## 8. LLM-Guided Reasoning Protocol


| Stage | Action | Validation |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Generate Candidates | LLM proposes proof strategies or solutions | Check alignment with formal requirements |
| Formal Verification | Apply rigorous logical verification | Ensure mathematical correctness |
| Feedback Integration | Update LLM reasoning based on verification results | Maintain accuracy of belief updates |

| 2 | Negation (∼) | Apply negation to statements |
| 3 | Conjunction (∧) or Disjunction (∨) | Evaluate conjunctions and disjunctions |
| 4 | Conditional (→) | Evaluate conditional statements |

## Application Guidelines for AI Agents

1. **Framework Selection**: Select the appropriate semantic framework based on the reasoning task at hand.
2. **Proof Construction**: Follow the proof construction steps when developing logical arguments.
3. **Error Prevention**: Apply PEPF and CEPF principles to detect and prevent reasoning errors.
4. **Semantic Bridging**: Use the ontological reasoning bridge to translate between semantic domains.
5. **Verification**: Apply the verification pipeline to ensure correctness of reasoning.
6. **Resource Allocation**: Distribute thinking tokens based on task complexity and risk.
7. **Truth Evaluation**: Use truth tables and order of operations to evaluate complex logical statements.
8. **BDI Integration**: Apply specific semantic frameworks to appropriate BDI components.

This integrated reasoning framework provides AI agents with a structured approach to logical reasoning, error prevention, and problem-solving across different semantic domains. By following these rules and protocols, agents can maintain formal correctness while leveraging the strengths of different reasoning frameworks.
