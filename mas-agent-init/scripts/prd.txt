# Tutorial-Cursor Integration Project

## Overview
This project aims to integrate the Tutorial-Cursor repository's code operation capabilities into our existing multi-agent system. The integration will enhance our agents' ability to read, analyze, and modify code while preserving our core multi-agent architecture.

## Project Scope
The project consists of five phases, each focusing on a specific aspect of the integration:

### Phase 1: Core File Operations
Implement the file operation capabilities from Tutorial-Cursor, including reading files, searching code, and listing directories. These operations will be adapted to work within our multi-agent architecture.

### Phase 2: Code Modification Framework
Develop a robust framework for modifying code based on Tutorial-Cursor's approach. This includes analyzing code, planning changes, and applying modifications with proper context preservation.

### Phase 3: Memory Bank Enhancement
Enhance our Memory Bank protocol to incorporate action history tracking. This will maintain context across operations and between different agents.

### Phase 4: Structured Response Parsing
Create a system for parsing YAML-formatted LLM responses for tool selection and operation planning. This will improve the Development Agent's code modification capabilities.

### Phase 5: Integration Testing
Develop comprehensive tests to ensure the new file operation and code modification tools work correctly with our existing agent system.

## Success Criteria
- All file operations (read, search, list) work correctly within our multi-agent system
- Code modification framework successfully analyzes and modifies code with proper context
- Memory Bank tracks action history and maintains context across operations
- Development Agent can parse structured LLM responses for tool selection
- All tests pass, verifying the integrated system works as expected

## Timeline
The project should be completed within 2 weeks, with each phase taking approximately 2-3 days.
