# Recommendations

Based on the current codebase analysis, requirements, and identified issues, the following actions are recommended to advance the project toward completion and deployment readiness:

## 1. Finalize Memory Bank Implementation
- Complete the code for action history tracking and context persistence across agents.
- Ensure robust integration with all agent workflows and validate with end-to-end tests.

## 2. Integrate Structured Response Parsing
- Fully implement the workflow for parsing YAML/structured LLM responses.
- Connect parsing utilities to agent decision-making and tool selection logic.
- Test with real-world LLM outputs to ensure reliability.

## 3. Expand and Strengthen Integration Testing
- Increase test coverage for multi-agent workflows, file operations, and code modification tools.
- Add tests for edge cases, error handling, and context resets.
- Use coverage tools to identify and address gaps.

## 4. Refactor and Consolidate Utilities
- Review utility modules (e.g., file operations, parsers) for duplication or unclear boundaries.
- Refactor for clarity, maintainability, and adherence to project coding standards.

## 5. Enhance Documentation
- Expand technical documentation for new features, protocols, and agent workflows.
- Provide clear examples and usage guides for developers and contributors.

## 6. Prepare for Deployment
- Conduct a final review of all success criteria in [`scripts/prd.txt`](scripts/prd.txt:1).
- Address any remaining gaps in features, tests, or documentation.
- Perform a dry-run deployment and resolve any issues encountered.
