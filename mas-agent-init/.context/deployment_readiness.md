# Deployment Readiness Assessment

## Overall Status

The Multi-Agent Context Sharing Memory System (MAMS) with Tutorial-Cursor integration is **not yet fully ready for deployment**, but is in an advanced state of implementation. Most core features are present, and the codebase is well-structured with clear modularity and documentation.

## Key Readiness Indicators

- **Core File Operations:** 90% complete and functional.
- **Code Modification Framework:** 70% complete; needs further integration and validation.
- **Memory Bank Enhancement:** 60% complete; protocols described, but implementation needs to be finalized.
- **Structured Response Parsing:** 50% complete; parsing utilities exist, but workflow integration is incomplete.
- **Integration Testing:** 60% complete; more coverage and edge case testing required.
- **Documentation:** Sufficient for onboarding, but technical details for new features need expansion.

## Blockers and Gaps

- Incomplete Memory Bank and structured response parsing workflows.
- Integration tests do not yet cover all multi-agent and edge case scenarios.
- Some utility modules may require refactoring for maintainability.
- Documentation for new protocols and workflows is not comprehensive.

## Actions Required for Deployment

1. **Finalize and test Memory Bank and structured response parsing features.**
2. **Expand integration and edge case testing; ensure all success criteria in [`scripts/prd.txt`](scripts/prd.txt:1) are met.**
3. **Refactor and consolidate utility modules as needed.**
4. **Enhance technical documentation for all new features and protocols.**
5. **Conduct a dry-run deployment and resolve any issues.**

## Readiness Verdict

**NOT READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**  
The project is close to deployment-ready, but the above blockers must be addressed. With focused effort on the remaining features, testing, and documentation, deployment readiness can be achieved in a short timeframe.
