# Feature Checklist and Completion Percentages

Based on the requirements in [`scripts/prd.txt`](scripts/prd.txt:1) and the current codebase structure:

## Phase 1: Core File Operations
- **Goal:** Implement file reading, searching, and directory listing for agents.
- **Evidence:** `src/cursor/fileReader.js`, `src/cursor/index.js`, `src/utils/fileOperations.js`
- **Completion:** 90% (core file operations present; may need integration validation)

## Phase 2: Code Modification Framework
- **Goal:** Framework for analyzing and modifying code with context preservation.
- **Evidence:** `src/cursor/parsers.js`, `src/agents/index.js`
- **Completion:** 70% (parsing and agent integration present; may need more robust modification logic)

## Phase 3: Memory Bank Enhancement
- **Goal:** Action history tracking and context maintenance across agents.
- **Evidence:** `.cursor/agent-system/shared/memory-bank/` (if present), references in `README.md`
- **Completion:** 60% (protocols described, but implementation details unclear in codebase)

## Phase 4: Structured Response Parsing
- **Goal:** Parse YAML-formatted LLM responses for tool selection and operation planning.
- **Evidence:** `src/cursor/parsers.js`, references in `README.md`
- **Completion:** 50% (parsing utilities exist, but full structured response workflow may not be complete)

## Phase 5: Integration Testing
- **Goal:** Comprehensive tests for file operations and code modification tools.
- **Evidence:** `tests/agents/`, `tests/cursor/`, `tests/utils/`
- **Completion:** 60% (test directories and files exist; coverage and completeness need review)
