# Task Delegation Framework

This document defines the principles, strategies, and best practices for effective task delegation across specialized agents in the Neo ecosystem. Task delegation is the foundation of efficient multi-agent workflows, ensuring that each component of work is assigned to the most appropriate agent.

## Core Delegation Principles

1. **Specialization Alignment**: Assign tasks to agents with the most relevant expertise
2. **Appropriate Granularity**: Tasks should be neither too large (overwhelming) nor too small (inefficient)
3. **Clear Requirements**: Each delegated task must have explicit, measurable outcomes
4. **Balanced Workload**: Distribute work to avoid bottlenecks and idle capacity
5. **Coherent Context**: Provide sufficient context for an agent to complete its task successfully

## Task Analysis Process

Before delegation, analyze tasks to determine proper assignment:

### 1. Task Decomposition

Break down complex tasks into discrete components that align with agent specializations:

- **Functional Decomposition**: Split by distinct functions or capabilities
- **Domain Decomposition**: Split by knowledge domain or subject area
- **Temporal Decomposition**: Split by phase or sequence
- **Responsibility Decomposition**: Split by ownership boundaries

**Example**: A "Build User Authentication System" task might decompose into:
- Design authentication flow (Architect)
- Implement backend authentication services (Backend)
- Create login/registration UI (Frontend)
- Secure credential storage (Security Specialist)
- Test authentication system (QA)

### 2. Dependency Mapping

Identify and document relationships between tasks:

- **Prerequisite Dependencies**: Tasks that must be completed before others can start
- **Finish-to-Start**: Most common, where one task must finish before another starts
- **Start-to-Start**: Tasks that can begin in parallel but have some relationship
- **Finish-to-Finish**: Tasks that must conclude together
- **Interface Dependencies**: Tasks that must produce or consume compatible outputs/inputs

Document dependencies in a dependency graph or matrix to visualize workflow.

### 3. Specialization Matching

Match task requirements to agent specializations:

| Category | Example Specializations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Technical | Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps, Mobile |
| Domain | Finance, Healthcare, E-commerce, Education |
| Functional | Architecture, QA, Security, Performance |
| Cross-cutting | Documentation, Compliance, Accessibility |

**Matching Criteria**:
- Primary skill alignment with core task requirements
- Secondary skills for supporting aspects
- Depth of expertise required (basic, intermediate, expert)
- Specific technologies or methodologies involved

## Delegation Decision Framework

Use this decision tree to determine the most appropriate agent for a task:

1. **Is this a specialized task requiring deep expertise in one area?**
   - Yes → Delegate to a specialist agent
   - No → Continue to question 2

2. **Does this task require significant context from prior work?**
   - Yes → Prefer an agent with existing context if qualified
   - No → Continue to question 3

3. **Does this task require integration of multiple specialized components?**
   - Yes → Delegate to an integration or orchestration agent
   - No → Continue to question 4

4. **Is this task experimental or exploratory in nature?**
   - Yes → Delegate to a research-oriented agent
   - No → Delegate based on primary technical/domain alignment

## Delegation Methods

### Direct Assignment

Used for straightforward tasks with clear ownership:

```
orchestrator.delegateTask({
  taskId: "TASK-123",
  title: "Implement User Login Component",
  assignee: "frontend-agent",
  priority: "high",
  dueDate: "2023-06-15",
  requirements: {...},
  context: {...}
});
```

**Best for**:
- Well-defined tasks with clear boundaries
- Tasks aligned with a single agent's specialization
- Routine tasks with established patterns

### Auction-Based Assignment

Used for tasks where multiple agents might be qualified:

```
orchestrator.auctionTask({
  taskId: "TASK-456",
  title: "Optimize Database Queries",
  eligibleAgents: ["database-agent", "backend-agent", "performance-agent"],
  selectionCriteria: {
    expertise: 0.7,
    availability: 0.2,
    contextFamiliarity: 0.1
  },
  requirements: {...},
  context: {...}
});
```

**Best for**:
- Tasks requiring specialized selection
- Balancing workload across similar agents
- Optimizing for multiple factors (expertise, availability)

### Hierarchical Delegation

Used for complex tasks requiring further decomposition:

```
orchestrator.delegateComplex({
  taskId: "TASK-789",
  title: "Build E-commerce Checkout Flow",
  primaryOwner: "feature-lead-agent",
  subTaskStrategy: "decompose-by-layer",
  approvalRequired: true,
  requirements: {...},
  context: {...}
});
```

**Best for**:
- Large features requiring multiple agents
- Tasks needing further analysis before assignment
- Work requiring coordination across specializations

## Task Specification Requirements

For successful delegation, each task must include:

### 1. Core Metadata

Required for all delegated tasks:

- **Unique Identifier**: Task tracking ID
- **Title**: Concise description
- **Type**: Category of work (implementation, design, testing, etc.)
- **Priority**: Importance/urgency (critical, high, medium, low)
- **Due Date**: Expected completion timeframe
- **Dependencies**: Related task IDs that must be completed first

### 2. Requirements Definition

Clear specification of expected outcomes:

- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable conditions for success
- **Constraints**: Technical, business, or resource limitations
- **Standards**: Coding standards, design patterns to follow
- **Performance Expectations**: Speed, efficiency, scalability targets

### 3. Contextual Information

Background knowledge needed for task execution:

- **Business Context**: Why this task matters
- **Technical Context**: System architecture, existing components
- **Prior Decisions**: Relevant design choices already made
- **Related Resources**: Documentation, specifications, diagrams

### 4. Output Specifications

Explicit definition of expected deliverables:

- **Artifact Format**: Code, documentation, diagram, etc.
- **Quality Requirements**: Testing, review, performance criteria
- **Handoff Process**: How deliverables should be returned
- **Integration Points**: How outputs connect to other components

## Workload Management

Strategies for balancing work across agents:

### Capacity Planning

- Maintain a capacity model for each agent
- Track current and planned utilization
- Reserve capacity for high-priority tasks
- Account for context-switching overhead

### Priority Management

Standardized prioritization framework:

| Priority | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Critical | Business-stopping issues | Immediate | Production outages, security breaches |
| High | Significant business impact | Same day | Feature blocking bugs, customer-impacting issues |
| Medium | Important but not urgent | Within sprint | Planned feature work, technical debt |
| Low | Limited impact or optional | When available | Minor enhancements, optimizations |

### Load Balancing Techniques

- **Round Robin**: Distribute similar tasks across qualified agents
- **Least Loaded**: Assign to agent with most available capacity
- **Skill-Based**: Prioritize best-fit over pure load balancing
- **Context-Based**: Group related tasks to same agent when possible

## Delegation Anti-patterns

Common pitfalls to avoid:

### 1. Specialization Mismatch

**Problem**: Assigning tasks to agents without required expertise
**Signs**: Excessive clarification requests, poor quality outputs
**Prevention**: Maintain detailed agent capability matrix
**Resolution**: Reassign to proper specialist, provide additional training

### 2. Overloaded Specialists

**Problem**: Overallocating work to highly specialized agents
**Signs**: Bottlenecks, delayed deliveries, burnout
**Prevention**: Cross-train agents, monitor workload metrics
**Resolution**: Redistribute work, add capacity, adjust priorities

### 3. Excessive Fragmentation

**Problem**: Breaking tasks into too many small pieces
**Signs**: High coordination overhead, integration issues
**Prevention**: Appropriate task granularity guidelines
**Resolution**: Consolidate related tasks, assign to single agent

### 4. Unclear Boundaries

**Problem**: Tasks with ambiguous responsibility boundaries
**Signs**: Duplicate work, gaps in implementation, conflicts
**Prevention**: Clear interface definitions, responsibility matrix
**Resolution**: Explicit boundary definition, coordination meeting

### 5. Context-Free Delegation

**Problem**: Providing insufficient context for assigned tasks
**Signs**: Frequent clarification needs, misaligned solutions
**Prevention**: Comprehensive task specification template
**Resolution**: Enhance context documentation, synchronization meeting
