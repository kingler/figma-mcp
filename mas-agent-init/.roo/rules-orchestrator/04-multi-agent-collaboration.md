# Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework

This document outlines the principles, patterns, and practices for orchestrating effective collaboration between specialized agents in the Neo ecosystem. The framework ensures that complex tasks requiring multiple specialized skills can be completed efficiently while maintaining coherence and quality.

## Core Collaboration Principles

1. **Clearly Defined Responsibilities**: Each agent should have well-defined areas of responsibility with minimal overlap
2. **Appropriate Specialization**: Tasks should be routed to agents with the most relevant expertise
3. **Consistent Communication**: All agents should use standardized protocols for information exchange
4. **Context Continuity**: Essential context must be maintained throughout multi-agent workflows
5. **Workflow Coherence**: The sequence of agent interactions should form a logical, efficient process

## Collaboration Patterns

Different scenarios require different collaboration patterns. The orchestrator should select the appropriate pattern based on task requirements:

### 1. Sequential Chain

```
[Agent A] → [Agent B] → [Agent C] → ... → [Final Output]
```

**When to use**: For tasks with clear, sequential dependencies where each agent builds directly on the work of the previous agent.

**Example**: Architecture design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment

**Implementation**:
- Each agent completes their portion fully before handoff
- Context is enriched at each step
- Each agent validates that their input meets requirements before proceeding

### 2. Fork and Join

```
                → [Agent B] → 
[Agent A] → Fork → [Agent C] → Join → [Agent E]
                → [Agent D] →
```

**When to use**: When a task can be decomposed into independent sub-tasks that can be worked on in parallel, then integrated.

**Example**: Breaking a feature into backend, frontend, and database components, then integrating them.

**Implementation**:
- Agent A decomposes the task and creates handoffs for each parallel path
- Agents B, C, and D work independently on their specialized components
- Join point integrates all parallel work before proceeding
- Agent E receives the integrated work product

### 3. Iterative Refinement

```
[Agent A] → [Agent B] → [Agent C]
     ↑                      ↓
     ←---------←---------←
```

**When to use**: For tasks requiring multiple passes of refinement from different perspectives.

**Example**: Initial UX mockup → Frontend implementation → UX review → Refinement

**Implementation**:
- Work cycles through specialized agents
- Each iteration includes specific feedback for improvement
- Predetermined acceptance criteria determine when to exit the loop
- Maximum iteration count prevents endless cycles

### 4. Expert Consultation

```
                  ↗ [Expert Agent X]
[Primary Agent] ←-→ [Expert Agent Y]
                  ↘ [Expert Agent Z]
```

**When to use**: When a primary agent needs specific expertise for portions of a task but maintains overall responsibility.

**Example**: Code Engineer consulting Security Specialist on authentication implementation

**Implementation**:
- Primary agent retains ownership of the task
- Expert agents provide specialized input on specific aspects
- Consultation requests contain focused questions
- Primary agent integrates expert input into the overall solution

### 5. Hierarchical Decomposition

```
[Orchestrator]
      ↓
   [Agent A]
  /    |    \
[B]   [C]   [D]
      / \
    [E] [F]
```

**When to use**: For complex tasks requiring multiple levels of decomposition and specialized skills at different levels.

**Example**: Building a complex feature requiring architecture, frontend, backend, database, and testing expertise.

**Implementation**:
- Orchestrator decomposes top-level task
- Sub-orchestration may occur at intermediate levels
- Roll-up reporting maintains overall project coherence
- Orchestrator ensures interfaces between components are well-defined

## Agent Selection & Task Allocation

For effective collaboration, tasks must be allocated to the most appropriate agents based on:

### Specialization Matching

| Specialization Type | Example Agents |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Technical Domain | Backend, Frontend, Database, Mobile |
| Functional | Architecture, Testing, DevOps, Security |
| Knowledge Area | Domain Expert, User Experience, Performance |

Selection criteria:
- Primary expertise alignment with core task requirements
- Secondary expertise for supporting aspects
- Available capacity and current workload
- Previous context familiarity

### Workload Balancing

- Assess agent capacity before allocation
- Consider task complexity and estimated effort
- Balance immediate needs with long-term efficiency
- Account for context-switching costs

### Context Familiarity

- Prefer agents with existing context knowledge where possible
- Balance specialization against context familiarity
- Consider context transfer costs for new agents
- Document key context for reference

## Communication Mechanisms

Effective collaboration requires structured communication:

### 1. Task Board Integration

- Centralized view of all in-progress tasks
- Clear visualization of dependencies
- Status tracking across agent boundaries
- Historical record of task progression

### 2. Artifact Repository

- Central storage for all work products
- Versioning for tracking changes
- Clear ownership and permissions
- Standardized organization structure

### 3. Contextual Handoffs

- Follow standardized handoff protocol
- Include all relevant context and requirements
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Document dependencies and constraints

### 4. Synchronization Points

- Scheduled integration of parallel work
- Dependency resolution meetings
- Cross-functional reviews
- Progress synchronization

## Conflict Resolution

When agents have different perspectives or approaches:

### Types of Conflicts

1. **Technical Approach Conflicts**: Disagreements about implementation methods
2. **Requirement Interpretation Conflicts**: Different understanding of requirements
3. **Integration Conflicts**: Issues with component interfaces or integration
4. **Priority Conflicts**: Competing resource demands or timeline considerations

### Resolution Process

1. **Fact-Based Analysis**:
   - Document differing perspectives with supporting evidence
   - Identify objective criteria for evaluation
   - Analyze trade-offs systematically

2. **Escalation Path**:
   - Agent-to-agent direct resolution attempt
   - Orchestrator mediation if direct resolution fails
   - Senior expert consultation for complex technical disputes
   - Business stakeholder input for requirement clarification

3. **Resolution Documentation**:
   - Record the final decision and rationale
   - Document implications and mitigations
   - Update relevant task definitions
   - Share decisions with all affected agents

## Quality Assurance

Maintaining quality across multi-agent workflows:

### Cross-Agent Review Process

- Implement peer reviews at key handoff points
- Use standardized review criteria
- Track and address review findings
- Establish minimum quality thresholds for progression

### Integration Testing

- Test interfaces between agent work products
- Verify end-to-end functionality
- Validate against original requirements
- Regression testing for iterative work

### Coherence Reviews

- Assess architectural consistency
- Verify implementation alignment with design
- Check for consistent patterns and approaches
- Validate overall solution coherence

## Collaboration Anti-patterns

Avoid these common collaboration pitfalls:

### 1. Responsibility Gaps

**Problem**: Areas where no agent has clear responsibility
**Prevention**: Define comprehensive responsibility matrix
**Detection**: Regular gap analysis in workflow
**Resolution**: Assign clear ownership for gap areas

### 2. Context Loss

**Problem**: Essential information lost between agent handoffs
**Prevention**: Standardized handoff documentation
**Detection**: Increased clarification requests
**Resolution**: Improve context transfer process, add synchronization points

### 3. Integration Failures

**Problem**: Components developed by different agents don't work together
**Prevention**: Clear interface definitions, early integration testing
**Detection**: Integration test failures, increasing defects
**Resolution**: Implement integration-first development approach

### 4. Duplication of Effort

**Problem**: Multiple agents working on the same thing unknowingly
**Prevention**: Clear task boundaries, centralized task tracking
**Detection**: Overlapping work products, redundant solutions
**Resolution**: Improve task decomposition and assignment processes

### 5. Feedback Loops

**Problem**: Changes cycling between agents without progress
**Prevention**: Clear acceptance criteria, maximum iteration limits
**Detection**: Multiple minor revisions without substantial progress
**Resolution**: Direct synchronization meeting, orchestrator intervention
