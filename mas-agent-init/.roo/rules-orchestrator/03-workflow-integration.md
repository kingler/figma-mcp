# Workflow Integration Framework

This document provides guidelines, patterns, and best practices for integrating specialized agents into cohesive workflows within the Neo ecosystem. Effective workflow integration enables agents to collaborate on complex tasks while maintaining clarity, consistency, and control.

## Core Workflow Principles

1. **Composability**: Break workflows into reusable modular components
2. **Determinism**: Ensure predictable behavior and outcomes
3. **Recoverability**: Design for resilience to interruptions and failures
4. **Transparency**: Make workflow states observable and debuggable
5. **Adaptability**: Allow workflows to evolve based on context changes

## Workflow Definition Building Blocks

Essential components for constructing effective multi-agent workflows:

### 1. Task Definitions

Atomic units of work with defined inputs and outputs:

- **Explicit Boundaries**: Clear start and completion criteria
- **Input Specifications**: Required data, formats, and schemas
- **Output Specifications**: Expected results and success criteria
- **Timeouts**: Maximum allowed execution duration
- **Retry Policies**: How to handle failures

**Example**: API Endpoint Development Task
```json
{
  "taskType": "api_development",
  "id": "API-123",
  "name": "Create User Registration Endpoint",
  "inputs": {
    "required": ["user_schema", "authentication_flow", "api_standards"],
    "formats": {
      "user_schema": "json-schema",
      "authentication_flow": "sequence-diagram",
      "api_standards": "markdown"
    }
  },
  "outputs": {
    "endpoint_code": {
      "path": "src/routes/auth/register.js",
      "format": "javascript"
    },
    "endpoint_tests": {
      "path": "tests/integration/auth/register.test.js",
      "format": "javascript"
    },
    "swagger_docs": {
      "path": "docs/swagger/auth.yaml",
      "format": "yaml"
    }
  },
  "timeout": "45m",
  "retryPolicy": {
    "maxAttempts": 2,
    "backoffStrategy": "exponential",
    "initialDelay": "30s"
  }
}
```

### 2. Transitions

Defined movements between tasks:

- **Condition-based**: Proceed when specific criteria are met
- **Event-driven**: Triggered by external or system events
- **Time-based**: Execute after a specific duration or at a set time
- **Manual**: Require human approval to proceed
- **Default**: Standard path when no other transitions apply

**Example**: Task Transition Configuration
```json
{
  "transitions": [
    {
      "from": "API-123",
      "to": "TEST-456",
      "type": "condition",
      "condition": "API-123.status === 'completed' && API-123.outputs.endpoint_code.exists",
      "transformations": [
        {
          "source": "API-123.outputs.endpoint_code",
          "target": "TEST-456.inputs.implementation",
          "transform": "identity"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "from": "API-123",
      "to": "REVIEW-789",
      "type": "manual",
      "approver": "tech-lead",
      "description": "Review API implementation before testing"
    },
    {
      "from": "API-123",
      "to": "ERROR-HANDLING",
      "type": "condition",
      "condition": "API-123.status === 'failed'",
      "priority": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Agent Assignments

Mapping tasks to appropriate agents:

- **Specialization Matching**: Align with agent capabilities
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work appropriately
- **Fallback Chains**: Define backup agents if preferred is unavailable
- **Team Assignments**: Multiple agents collaborating on a single task
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Runtime determination based on context

**Example**: Agent Assignment Rules
```json
{
  "assignments": [
    {
      "taskPattern": "api_development.*",
      "primaryAgent": "backend-developer",
      "fallbacks": ["full-stack-developer"],
      "exclusions": ["API-567"],
      "constraints": {
        "maxConcurrentTasks": 3,
        "requiredCapabilities": ["node-js", "express", "mongodb"]
      }
    },
    {
      "taskId": "API-567",
      "primaryAgent": "security-specialist",
      "assistingAgents": ["backend-developer"],
      "reason": "Payment API requires security expertise"
    },
    {
      "taskPattern": "deployment.*",
      "assignmentStrategy": "dynamic",
      "strategyImplementation": "scripts/assign-deployment-agent.js",
      "parameters": {
        "considerWorkload": true,
        "preferredAgents": ["devops-engineer-1", "devops-engineer-2"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Decision Points

Places in workflows where conditional branching occurs:

- **Binary Decisions**: Simple yes/no branches
- **Multi-path Decisions**: Multiple possible next steps
- **Data-driven Decisions**: Based on runtime information
- **Policy-based Decisions**: Following predefined rules
- **ML-based Decisions**: Using trained models to determine path

**Example**: Decision Point Configuration
```json
{
  "decisionPoints": [
    {
      "id": "dp-1",
      "name": "API Implementation Approach",
      "description": "Determine whether to use REST or GraphQL",
      "inputs": ["client_requirements", "performance_metrics", "team_expertise"],
      "outcomes": [
        {
          "id": "rest-approach",
          "condition": "client_requirements.includes('mobile-compatibility') && team_expertise.rest > team_expertise.graphql",
          "next": "REST-IMPLEMENTATION",
          "metadata": {
            "rationale": "Mobile compatibility with existing team REST expertise"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "graphql-approach",
          "condition": "client_requirements.includes('data-efficiency') || client_requirements.includes('flexible-queries')",
          "next": "GRAPHQL-IMPLEMENTATION",
          "metadata": {
            "rationale": "Data efficiency requirements better suited to GraphQL"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "default-approach",
          "condition": "true",
          "next": "REST-IMPLEMENTATION",
          "metadata": {
            "rationale": "Default to REST when no specific requirements"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workflow Patterns

Common patterns for orchestrating multi-agent workflows:

### 1. Sequential Workflow

A linear progression of tasks:

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Each agent performs its task and passes to next
- **Validation Gates**: Quality checks between phases
- **Accumulative Context**: Context enriched at each step
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility of current position

**Best for**:
- Processes with clear, ordered dependencies
- Workflows where each step builds on previous results
- Simple, predictable task progressions

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Sequential workflow definition
const workflow = orchestrator.createWorkflow({
  id: "feature-development",
  pattern: "sequential",
  steps: [
    {
      id: "requirements-analysis",
      agent: "business-analyst",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.requirements,
      estimatedDuration: "2h"
    },
    {
      id: "ui-design",
      agent: "ui-designer",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.uiDesign,
      requiresOutputsFrom: ["requirements-analysis"]
    },
    {
      id: "frontend-implementation",
      agent: "frontend-developer",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.frontendDev,
      requiresOutputsFrom: ["ui-design"]
    },
    {
      id: "testing",
      agent: "qa-tester",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.integration,
      requiresOutputsFrom: ["frontend-implementation"]
    }
  ]
});
```

### 2. Parallel Workflow

Multiple tasks executing concurrently:

- **Fan-out/Fan-in**: Distribute work then aggregate results
- **Independent Subtasks**: Work that can proceed in isolation
- **Synchronization Points**: Defined convergence moments
- **Resource Allocation**: Managing concurrent execution needs

**Best for**:
- Tasks with minimal interdependencies
- Time-sensitive processes
- Maximizing resource utilization

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Parallel workflow with synchronization
const workflow = orchestrator.createWorkflow({
  id: "app-deployment",
  pattern: "parallel",
  steps: {
    initial: "preparation",
    preparation: {
      agent: "devops-engineer",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.deployPrep,
      next: ["frontend-deploy", "backend-deploy", "database-migrate"]
    },
    "frontend-deploy": {
      agent: "frontend-specialist",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.frontendDeploy,
      next: "integration-test"
    },
    "backend-deploy": {
      agent: "backend-specialist",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.backendDeploy,
      next: "integration-test"
    },
    "database-migrate": {
      agent: "database-admin",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.dbMigration,
      next: "integration-test"
    },
    "integration-test": {
      agent: "qa-tester",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.integrationTest,
      wait: ["frontend-deploy", "backend-deploy", "database-migrate"],
      next: "finalize"
    },
    "finalize": {
      agent: "devops-engineer",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.deployFinalize
    }
  }
});
```

### 3. State Machine Workflow

Explicit state transitions with defined triggers:

- **State-based Logic**: Different behaviors in different states
- **Event-driven Transitions**: Move between states based on events
- **Guard Conditions**: Prevent invalid state transitions
- **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to repeat or retry

**Best for**:
- Complex workflows with many possible paths
- Systems where the state needs to be explicitly tracked
- Processes that may pause, resume, or change direction

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// State machine workflow definition
const workflow = orchestrator.createWorkflow({
  id: "bug-resolution",
  pattern: "state-machine",
  initialState: "reported",
  states: {
    "reported": {
      agent: "triage-specialist",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.triageBug,
      transitions: [
        { on: "verified", to: "in-progress", conditions: ["hasReproductionSteps"] },
        { on: "needsInfo", to: "waiting-for-info" },
        { on: "invalid", to: "closed" }
      ]
    },
    "waiting-for-info": {
      agent: "support-engineer",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.gatherInfo,
      transitions: [
        { on: "infoReceived", to: "reported" },
        { on: "timeout", to: "closed", after: "7d" }
      ]
    },
    "in-progress": {
      agent: "developer",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.fixBug,
      transitions: [
        { on: "fixed", to: "in-review" },
        { on: "blocked", to: "blocked" }
      ]
    },
    "blocked": {
      agent: "tech-lead",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.resolveBlocker,
      transitions: [
        { on: "unblocked", to: "in-progress" },
        { on: "wontFix", to: "closed" }
      ]
    },
    "in-review": {
      agent: "code-reviewer",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.reviewFix,
      transitions: [
        { on: "approved", to: "ready-for-testing" },
        { on: "changes", to: "in-progress" }
      ]
    },
    "ready-for-testing": {
      agent: "qa-tester",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.testFix,
      transitions: [
        { on: "verified", to: "closed" },
        { on: "failed", to: "in-progress" }
      ]
    },
    "closed": {
      type: "terminal",
      onEntry: [notifyStakeholders, updateMetrics]
    }
  }
});
```

### 4. Dynamic Workflow

Adapting structure based on context and decisions:

- **Runtime Path Determination**: Workflow shape evolves during execution
- **Conditional Subflows**: Include or skip workflow segments
- **Generated Tasks**: Create new tasks based on discoveries
- **Strategy Selection**: Choose among alternative approaches

**Best for**:
- Exploratory processes
- Workflows requiring adaptation to findings
- Situations where the full process cannot be predetermined

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Dynamic workflow with runtime decisions
const workflow = orchestrator.createWorkflow({
  id: "security-assessment",
  pattern: "dynamic",
  initialStep: "scan-planning",
  steps: {
    "scan-planning": {
      agent: "security-analyst",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.securityScopePlanning,
      next: context => {
        // Determine scan types based on initial assessment
        const scanTypes = [];
        if (context.hasExternalApis) scanTypes.push("api-security-scan");
        if (context.hasDatabaseAccess) scanTypes.push("database-security-scan");
        if (context.hasUserAuth) scanTypes.push("authentication-security-scan");
        
        // Always include general vulnerability scan
        scanTypes.push("vulnerability-scan");
        
        return scanTypes;
      }
    },
    "api-security-scan": {
      agent: "api-security-specialist",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.apiSecurityScan,
      next: "report-aggregation"
    },
    "database-security-scan": {
      agent: "database-security-specialist",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.databaseSecurityScan,
      next: "report-aggregation"
    },
    "authentication-security-scan": {
      agent: "auth-security-specialist",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.authSecurityScan,
      next: "report-aggregation"
    },
    "vulnerability-scan": {
      agent: "vulnerability-scanner",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.vulnerabilityScan,
      next: "report-aggregation"
    },
    "report-aggregation": {
      agent: "security-lead",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.securityReportAggregation,
      wait: context => {
        // Wait for all dynamically determined scan types
        return context.activatedSteps.filter(step => step.endsWith("-scan"));
      },
      next: context => {
        // Determine if remediation is needed based on findings
        return context.criticalVulnerabilitiesFound ? "remediation-planning" : "final-report";
      }
    },
    "remediation-planning": {
      agent: "security-engineer",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.securityRemediationPlanning,
      next: "final-report"
    },
    "final-report": {
      agent: "security-lead",
      task: TASK_DEFINITIONS.securityFinalReport
    }
  }
});
```

## Workflow Management & Monitoring

Tools and techniques for maintaining workflow health:

### 1. Workflow Visibility

Providing insight into workflow state:

- **Visual Tracking**: Graphical representation of workflow status
- **Progress Metrics**: Completion percentage, time spent/remaining
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Highlighting stalled or delayed steps
- **Resource Utilization**: Agent workload and availability
- **Historical Trends**: Patterns of workflow execution over time

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Workflow dashboard configuration
orchestrator.configureDashboard({
  workflows: ["feature-development", "bug-resolution", "deployment"],
  views: [
    {
      name: "Status Overview",
      type: "gantt",
      metrics: ["progress", "timeline-variance", "blockages"]
    },
    {
      name: "Agent Utilization",
      type: "heatmap",
      metrics: ["workload", "idle-time", "task-completion-rate"]
    },
    {
      name: "Workflow Performance",
      type: "timeseries",
      metrics: ["average-completion-time", "success-rate", "rework-percentage"],
      timeframe: "last-30-days",
      groupBy: "workflow-type"
    }
  ],
  alerts: [
    {
      condition: "task.duration > task.estimatedDuration * 1.5",
      severity: "warning",
      notification: "slack:#project-alerts"
    },
    {
      condition: "workflow.blockedTime > 4h",
      severity: "critical",
      notification: ["email:project-lead@example.com", "sms:+1234567890"]
    }
  ]
});
```

### 2. Control Mechanisms

Ways to manage workflow execution:

- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily suspend and restart workflows
- **Cancellation**: Cleanly terminate workflow execution
- **Skipping Steps**: Bypass non-critical workflow segments
- **Priority Adjustments**: Re-prioritize tasks during execution
- **Manual Intervention**: Allow human overrides at key points

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Workflow control API examples
const workflowControls = {
  // Pause a running workflow
  pauseWorkflow: async (workflowId, reason = "Manual pause") => {
    return await orchestrator.control({
      action: "pause",
      workflowId,
      metadata: { reason, timestamp: new Date(), initiator: "admin" }
    });
  },
  
  // Resume a paused workflow
  resumeWorkflow: async (workflowId) => {
    return await orchestrator.control({
      action: "resume",
      workflowId,
      metadata: { timestamp: new Date(), initiator: "admin" }
    });
  },
  
  // Skip a workflow step
  skipStep: async (workflowId, stepId, alternatives = {}) => {
    return await orchestrator.control({
      action: "skip",
      workflowId,
      stepId,
      alternatives, // Optional outputs to fabricate for downstream steps
      metadata: { reason: "Step not applicable", initiator: "tech-lead" }
    });
  },
  
  // Modify workflow in-flight
  modifyWorkflow: async (workflowId, modifications) => {
    return await orchestrator.control({
      action: "modify",
      workflowId,
      modifications, // Can add/remove steps, change assignments, etc.
      metadata: { reason: "Responding to changing requirements", initiator: "product-manager" }
    });
  }
};
```

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery

Strategies for managing workflow failure:

- **Retry Strategies**: Policies for reattempting failed tasks
- **Compensation Logic**: Undoing effects of failed workflows
- **Partial Completion**: Handling partially successful workflows
- **Timeout Management**: Dealing with non-responsive tasks
- **Fallback Paths**: Alternative routes when ideal path fails

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Error handling configuration
const errorHandlingConfig = {
  // Global retry policies
  retryPolicies: {
    "network-related": {
      maxAttempts: 3,
      backoff: "exponential",
      baseDelay: "5s",
      maxDelay: "1m"
    },
    "resource-related": {
      maxAttempts: 5,
      backoff: "linear",
      baseDelay: "30s"
    },
    "timeout-related": {
      maxAttempts: 2,
      backoff: "fixed",
      baseDelay: "1m"
    }
  },
  
  // Task failure handlers
  failureHandlers: {
    "api-development": async (context, error) => {
      if (error.type === "syntax-error") {
        // Attempt auto-correction
        await agents.get("code-fixer").fix({
          code: context.task.outputs.code,
          error: error.details
        });
        return { action: "retry" };
      }
      
      if (error.type === "integration-error") {
        // Notify integration team and wait
        await notifications.send("integration-team", {
          message: `Integration error in ${context.task.id}`,
          details: error
        });
        return { action: "human-intervention" };
      }
      
      // Default handler
      return { action: "escalate" };
    }
  },
  
  // Compensation handlers (for undoing effects)
  compensationHandlers: {
    "database-migration": async (context) => {
      // Roll back database changes
      await agents.get("database-admin").executeRollback({
        migrationId: context.task.outputs.migrationId
      });
      
      return { success: true };
    },
    "resource-provisioning": async (context) => {
      // Deprovision created resources
      await agents.get("cloud-admin").deprovisionResources({
        resources: context.task.outputs.provisionedResources
      });
      
      return { success: true };
    }
  }
};
```

## Workflow Integration Anti-patterns

Common pitfalls to avoid:

### 1. Monolithic Workflows

**Problem**: Creating giant, all-encompassing workflow definitions
**Signs**: Excessive complexity, difficult maintenance, low reusability
**Prevention**: Break into modular subflows, use composition patterns
**Resolution**: Refactor into smaller, purpose-specific workflows that can be composed

### 2. State Explosion

**Problem**: Too many conditional branches and states
**Signs**: Unpredictable behavior, testing difficulties, maintenance nightmares
**Prevention**: Abstract similar states, use hierarchical state machines, simplify decision logic
**Resolution**: Consolidate similar states, introduce higher-level abstractions, refactor to dynamic workflows

### 3. Rigid Coupling

**Problem**: Hardcoding dependencies between workflow steps
**Signs**: Fragile workflows that break when individual components change
**Prevention**: Event-driven coupling, well-defined interfaces, contract-based integration
**Resolution**: Replace direct calls with event-based coordination, define clear input/output contracts

### 4. Runaway Workflows

**Problem**: Long-running workflows with no boundaries
**Signs**: Resource exhaustion, unclear completion criteria, zombie processes
**Prevention**: Explicit timeouts, heartbeat mechanisms, circuit breakers
**Resolution**: Implement monitoring, add timeout handlers, design for graceful termination

### 5. Context Loss

**Problem**: Information disappearing between workflow steps
**Signs**: Agents requesting already provided information, inconsistent decisions
**Prevention**: Structured context passing, shared context repository, explicit state management
**Resolution**: Implement consistent context persistence, add context validation between steps

## Implementation Guidelines

Practical advice for workflow integration:

### 1. Preparation Phase

- Catalog existing workflows and their characteristics
- Identify common patterns and integration points
- Define standard task and transition templates
- Establish naming conventions and metadata standards

### 2. Design Phase

- Start with high-level workflow diagrams before implementation
- Focus on transitions and decision points before task details
- Design for observability from the beginning
- Plan for failure recovery in every workflow

### 3. Implementation Phase

- Build a library of reusable workflow components
- Implement common utilities for context passing
- Add comprehensive logging at key workflow points
- Create recovery mechanisms for all workflow types

### 4. Testing Phase

- Test each workflow component in isolation
- Validate full workflows with simulated agents
- Use chaos engineering to verify error handling
- Benchmark performance with realistic workloads

### 5. Deployment Phase

- Roll out workflows gradually, starting with non-critical paths
- Implement parallel running of old and new workflows for comparison
- Monitor closely for unexpected behavior or performance issues
- Gather feedback from all stakeholders, including the agents themselves
