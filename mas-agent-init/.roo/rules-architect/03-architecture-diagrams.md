# Architecture Diagrams: Standards & Best Practices

Effective architecture diagrams are essential for communicating design decisions and system structure. This document outlines standards and best practices for creating clear, informative architecture diagrams.

## Diagram Types & Their Purpose

### C4 Model Diagrams

The C4 model provides a hierarchical approach to diagramming software architecture:

1. **Context Diagram (Level 1)**
   - Shows the system in context of its users and other systems
   - Answers: "What is the system and who uses it?"
   - Keep it simple with just the system, users, and external dependencies

2. **Container Diagram (Level 2)**
   - Shows the high-level technical components (containers)
   - Includes web servers, applications, databases, file systems
   - Answers: "What are the technology components and how do they interact?"

3. **Component Diagram (Level 3)**
   - Shows logical components inside containers
   - Represents major functional areas or modules
   - Answers: "How is a specific container decomposed?"

4. **Code Diagram (Level 4)**
   - Shows implementation details (typically UML)
   - Only create for the most critical components
   - Answers: "How is a specific component implemented?"

### Additional Diagram Types

5. **Sequence Diagrams**
   - Shows the order of interactions between components
   - Essential for complex processes spanning multiple components
   - Focus on the most important paths, not every edge case

6. **Deployment Diagrams**
   - Shows how software maps to infrastructure
   - Includes servers, cloud services, networking
   - Essential for understanding operational requirements

7. **Data Flow Diagrams**
   - Shows how data moves through the system
   - Useful for data-intensive applications
   - Helps identify potential performance bottlenecks

## Diagram Creation Guidelines

### General Best Practices

- **Start with the audience in mind**
  - Technical detail should match audience expertise
  - Executive diagrams should be higher-level than developer diagrams
  
- **Layer complexity gradually**
  - Begin with simple high-level diagrams
  - Add detail in subsequent, more focused diagrams
  - Never try to show everything in one diagram
  
- **Maintain consistent notation**
  - Use the same symbols for the same concepts across all diagrams
  - Define a legend for all non-standard symbols
  - Follow established notations like C4, UML, or ArchiMate when possible

- **Focus on a single concern per diagram**
  - Structure in one view, behavior in another
  - Static relationships separate from dynamic flows
  - Security considerations in dedicated views

### Visual Design Principles

- **Use color purposefully**
  - Distinguish between different types of components
  - Highlight critical paths or components
  - Consider colorblind-friendly palettes
  - Ensure diagrams are still clear when printed in black and white

- **Employ layout meaningfully**
  - Flow typically left-to-right or top-to-bottom
  - Group related components visually
  - Use consistent sizing (larger ≠ more important)
  - Minimize line crossings and overlaps

- **Label clearly and consistently**
  - Every component should have a descriptive name
  - Label interactions with their purpose
  - Use a consistent naming convention
  - Include technology choices where relevant

- **Manage complexity**
  - Limit to 7±2 elements per diagram when possible
  - Use abstraction to hide unnecessary details
  - Create hierarchical diagrams that allow drilling down
  - Break complex diagrams into multiple views

## Tools & Technologies

### Recommended Diagramming Tools

- **[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)**
  - Text-based diagrams that can be version-controlled
  - Good for sequence, component, and class diagrams
  - Integration with documentation tools

- **[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/)**
  - Markdown-based diagramming
  - Good for simple diagrams directly in documentation
  - Limited but growing feature set

- **[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)**
  - Web-based collaborative diagramming
  - Extensive shape libraries
  - Good for teams with non-technical stakeholders

- **[draw.io](https://draw.io/)** / **[diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net/)**
  - Free and powerful web-based tool
  - Extensive templates and shape libraries
  - Can be saved to various cloud services

- **[Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/)**
  - Specifically designed for the C4 model
  - Offers code-based diagram definition
  - Maintains consistency across diagram levels

### Diagram as Code Benefits

- **Version control integration**
  - Track changes over time
  - Connect diagrams to code versions
  - Enable pull request reviews of architectural changes

- **Automation possibilities**
  - Generate diagrams from actual codebase
  - Update diagrams as part of CI/CD
  - Validate architecture conformance

- **Consistency enforcement**
  - Standardized templates and styles
  - Reusable components across diagrams
  - Easier maintenance of diagram families

## Diagram Maintenance

- **Keep diagrams up-to-date**
  - Schedule regular reviews of architectural diagrams
  - Update diagrams when making significant architecture changes
  - Consider automated approaches for keeping diagrams fresh

- **Store with related artifacts**
  - Keep diagrams close to the code they represent
  - Include diagrams in architecture decision records
  - Link diagrams from documentation

- **Use appropriate detail levels**
  - Highly volatile areas should be diagrammed at higher levels
  - Stable core components can include more detail
  - Balance completeness with maintenance burden

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Overloaded diagrams**
  - Too many elements or relationships
  - Multiple concerns in a single view
  - Information overload leading to confusion

- **Inconsistent notation**
  - Mixing multiple diagramming standards
  - Using the same symbol for different concepts
  - Using different symbols for the same concept

- **Missing context**
  - Diagrams without clear purpose or scope
  - Unlabeled components or relationships
  - No indication of diagram's place in the bigger picture

- **Obsolete information**
  - Outdated diagrams that don't reflect current architecture
  - Aspirational diagrams presented as reality
  - Missing critical new components or interactions
