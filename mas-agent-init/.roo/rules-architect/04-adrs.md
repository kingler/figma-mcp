# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document significant architectural decisions, capturing context, options considered, and the reasoning behind the chosen solution. This guidance helps architects create clear, useful ADRs.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs are:

- **Short text documents** (typically 1-2 pages)
- **Self-contained** with all necessary context
- **Immutable** once approved (though they can be superseded)
- **Sequentially numbered** for easy reference

## When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR whenever you make a decision that:

- Has a significant impact on the system architecture
- Affects multiple teams or components
- Introduces or removes major technologies
- Sets precedents for future development
- Involves meaningful tradeoffs with pros and cons
- Would benefit from being explicitly documented

Examples include:
- Choosing a database technology
- Selecting a deployment strategy
- Determining API design patterns
- Establishing authentication mechanisms
- Defining integration approaches with external systems

## ADR Template Structure

### 1. Title

```
# ADR-0001: Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database
```

- Number ADRs sequentially (ADR-NNNN)
- Use an active, present-tense verb
- State the decision clearly

### 2. Status

```
## Status
Accepted (2023-07-15)
```

Common status values:
- **Proposed**: Initial draft, under discussion
- **Accepted**: Approved decision being implemented
- **Deprecated**: Still valid but not recommended for new use
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR (reference the new one)
- **Rejected**: Decision was considered but not adopted

### 3. Context

```
## Context
Our application needs to store structured data with complex relationships.
Transaction support is essential for maintaining data integrity during
multi-step operations. We expect moderate growth in data volume over the
next two years (~50GB). The development team has experience with both
SQL and NoSQL databases.
```

- Describe the forces at play
- Explain why this decision needs to be made
- Include technical, business, and team context
- State constraints and requirements
- Keep factual, avoid justifying a decision yet

### 4. Decision

```
## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database for storing all application
data. We will run PostgreSQL in a managed cloud service (AWS RDS) to
minimize operational overhead.
```

- Clearly state the decision
- Be specific about implementation details
- Describe how the decision will be applied
- Use decisive language ("We will..." not "We should...")

### 5. Alternatives Considered

```
## Alternatives Considered

### MongoDB
- Pros: Flexible schema, good for document storage, team familiarity
- Cons: Less mature transaction support, relational queries more complex

### MySQL
- Pros: Widely used, good community support, relational model
- Cons: Less advanced features than PostgreSQL, weaker JSON capabilities

### DynamoDB
- Pros: Fully managed, high scalability, AWS native integration
- Cons: Limited query capabilities, higher learning curve for the team
```

- List all viable alternatives that were considered
- Include brief pros and cons for each
- Be fair to alternatives; avoid bias toward the chosen solution
- Include the "do nothing" option if relevant

### 6. Consequences

```
## Consequences

### Positive
- Strong transaction support ensures data integrity
- Rich feature set supports complex queries and JSON data
- Familiar SQL syntax reduces learning curve for most team members
- JSONB support provides flexibility for semi-structured data

### Negative
- Will require provisioning and maintaining database backups
- Connection pooling needed for optimal performance at scale
- Horizontal scaling more complex than with some NoSQL options
```

- Describe both positive and negative consequences
- Include technical, operational, and business impacts
- Consider short-term and long-term effects
- Be honest about limitations and risks

### 7. Compliance Verification (Optional)

```
## Compliance
- Database choice is compatible with our data residency requirements
- Meets security team's encryption requirements (encryption at rest/in transit)
- AWS RDS for PostgreSQL is already approved by IT security
```

- How will you verify the decision is implemented correctly?
- What are the compliance requirements?
- How does this align with governance policies?

## ADR Best Practices

### Writing Effective ADRs

- **Be concise**: 1-2 pages maximum
- **Use clear language**: Avoid jargon and ambiguity
- **Focus on rationale**: Explain why, not just what
- **Avoid excessive detail**: Reference external documents for deep technical details
- **Be honest about tradeoffs**: No solution is perfect
- **Use diagrams when helpful**: A picture can be worth a thousand words
- **Get peer review**: Have colleagues review for clarity and completeness

### Managing ADRs

- **Store with code**: Keep ADRs in version control
- **Make them discoverable**: Use a consistent location and indexing
- **Reference from other documents**: Link to ADRs from related documentation
- **Don't change past ADRs**: Create new ones that supersede old ones
- **Review periodically**: Ensure ADRs are still relevant and accurate

## ADR Workflow

1. **Draft**: Author drafts the ADR as a proposed document
2. **Review**: Share with stakeholders for feedback
3. **Revision**: Update based on feedback
4. **Decision**: Formally accept (or reject) the ADR
5. **Publication**: Merge to repository with accepted status
6. **Reference**: Link to the ADR from relevant documentation

## Tools and Templates

- **Markdown templates**: Simple, version-control friendly format
- **[ADR Tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)**: CLI tools for managing ADRs
- **[Documize](https://documize.com/)**: Collaborative documentation platform with ADR templates
- **[Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/)**: Architecture documentation tools with ADR support

## Common ADR Pitfalls

- **Too vague**: Not providing specific, actionable decisions
- **Missing context**: Not explaining why the decision was necessary
- **Ignoring alternatives**: Not documenting other options considered
- **Hidden constraints**: Not making explicit the limitations that influenced the decision
- **No consequences**: Not explaining the impacts of the decision
- **Technical focus only**: Ignoring business or operational impacts
- **Overengineering the document**: Making ADRs too complex or formal

## ADR Examples

Here's a simplified example:

```markdown
# ADR-0005: Adopt GraphQL for API Layer

## Status
Accepted (2023-09-10)

## Context
Our client applications need to fetch related data in a single request.
REST APIs require multiple round trips and often return more data than needed.
Mobile clients especially need efficient data loading. The frontend team
is experiencing significant development delays due to these inefficiencies.

## Decision
We will implement GraphQL as our primary API technology. We'll use Apollo
Server with Node.js for the implementation. All new APIs will use GraphQL,
and we'll gradually migrate existing critical REST endpoints to GraphQL.

## Alternatives Considered

### Enhanced REST with custom endpoints
- Pros: Familiar technology, no new tools
- Cons: Still requires custom endpoints for each use case, increased backend complexity

### OData
- Pros: Standardized query language, good for data filtering
- Cons: Less flexible for complex relationships, fewer client libraries

### gRPC
- Pros: High performance, strong typing
- Cons: Poor browser support, steeper learning curve

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clients can request exactly the data they need
- Reduces number of API calls and bandwidth usage
- Self-documenting API through GraphQL schema
- Strong type system improves developer experience

### Negative
- Learning curve for team members new to GraphQL
- Potential performance issues with complex queries
- More complex caching strategy needed
- Requires careful monitoring for N+1 query problems
```

Remember that ADRs should evolve with your team's needs and preferences. Start simple and refine your approach over time.
