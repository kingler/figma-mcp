# Architecture Patterns & Their Applications

This document outlines common architecture patterns, when to use them, and their key characteristics to help you select the appropriate pattern for your design tasks.

## Monolithic Architecture

**Description**: An application is built as a single unit with tightly coupled components.

**When to Use**:
- Simple applications with limited complexity
- Projects with small development teams
- Early startup MVPs with uncertain requirements
- When development speed is prioritized over scalability

**Key Characteristics**:
- Simple to develop and deploy
- Easier to test end-to-end
- Lower initial complexity
- More difficult to scale horizontally
- Technology stack decisions affect the entire application

## Microservices Architecture

**Description**: Application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over a network.

**When to Use**:
- Large, complex applications
- Applications requiring independent scaling of components
- Projects with multiple development teams
- Systems needing high availability and resilience
- Applications expected to grow significantly over time

**Key Characteristics**:
- Independent deployment and scalability of services
- Technology diversity possible across services
- More complex to develop, test, and deploy
- Requires robust service discovery and monitoring
- Introduces network latency and distributed system challenges

## Event-Driven Architecture

**Description**: Components communicate through events, decoupling producers and consumers.

**When to Use**:
- Systems with unpredictable or bursty workloads
- Applications requiring real-time data processing
- Integration of multiple systems
- When building reactive systems
- Scenarios demanding high scalability and loose coupling

**Key Characteristics**:
- Highly decoupled components
- Good for handling asynchronous operations
- Can provide better responsiveness under load
- More complex to debug and understand flow
- Requires robust event bus/message broker

## Layered Architecture

**Description**: Application is organized into horizontal layers, each with a specific responsibility.

**When to Use**:
- General-purpose applications
- When separation of concerns is important
- Projects with developers of different expertise levels
- Systems with clear distinction between UI, business logic, and data access

**Key Characteristics**:
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Easier to understand for new developers
- Can lead to "layer leakage" if not carefully designed
- Changes may affect multiple layers
- Often used within other architectural patterns

## Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

**Description**: Core business logic is isolated from external concerns through ports and adapters.

**When to Use**:
- Applications requiring technology independence
- Systems needing high testability
- Projects with changing external interfaces
- When business rules need protection from UI/infrastructure changes

**Key Characteristics**:
- Business logic is isolated and framework-agnostic
- External dependencies are easily swappable
- Highly testable due to clear boundaries
- Requires more initial planning and architecture
- Excellent for long-lived applications

## Serverless Architecture

**Description**: Application logic runs in stateless, event-triggered compute containers managed by third parties.

**When to Use**:
- Applications with variable workloads
- Microservices with distinct, independent functions
- Projects needing to minimize operational management
- Systems where cost efficiency is paramount
- When rapid development and deployment are priorities

**Key Characteristics**:
- No server management required
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Inherent scalability
- Limited execution time
- Potential for vendor lock-in
- Cold start latency issues

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Description**: Architecture focused on modeling complex domains accurately in software.

**When to Use**:
- Complex business domains
- Projects with significant business logic
- When close collaboration with domain experts is possible
- Systems where business rules are more important than technical concerns

**Key Characteristics**:
- Ubiquitous language shared between developers and domain experts
- Bounded contexts to separate different domain areas
- Focus on the core domain
- Often combined with other architectural patterns
- Requires significant domain knowledge

## CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**Description**: Separates read and write operations into different models.

**When to Use**:
- Applications with complex domain models
- Systems with significant disparity between read and write workloads
- When different optimization strategies are needed for reads vs. writes
- Projects requiring high performance for specific operations

**Key Characteristics**:
- Separate models for reading and writing
- Can use different data stores optimized for each purpose
- Increases complexity but allows specialized optimization
- Often paired with Event Sourcing
- Good for complex domains with varying query requirements

## Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Description**: Functionality is grouped into interoperable services that can be used across systems.

**When to Use**:
- Enterprise-scale applications
- Organizations with multiple systems that need integration
- When service reuse across applications is valuable
- Large, diverse technology landscapes

**Key Characteristics**:
- Services represent business capabilities
- Standardized service contracts
- Loose coupling between services
- Often implemented with an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
- More emphasis on standardization than microservices

## Selecting the Right Pattern

When selecting an architecture pattern, consider:

1. **Business Requirements**: What does the business need to achieve?
2. **Scale & Performance**: How much will the system need to scale?
3. **Team Structure**: How are development teams organized?
4. **Deployment Requirements**: How frequently will the application need to be updated?
5. **Technology Constraints**: Are there existing technology investments to consider?
6. **Operational Capabilities**: What is the organization's capability to operate complex systems?

Remember that hybrid architectures combining multiple patterns are common and often appropriate. The best architecture is one that meets the specific needs of your project, not necessarily the most trendy or sophisticated one.
